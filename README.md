# My Rust Matrix Lib

The point of this branch is to add SIMD instructions to make it even more faster !

This project is a librairy written in rust, that perform some linear algebra computation.  
The purpose of this is only to train myself, in rust, and math, and maybe some personal usage.
I will **not** maintain it forever.  

## feature to add

- [ ] DOC && TEST algebra traits
- [ ] DOC && TEST quaternions
- [ ] rank of a matrix
- [ ] eigenvalues / eigenvectors
- [ ] unknow size vector and matrix
